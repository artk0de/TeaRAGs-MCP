/**
 * Per-collection DuckDB pool for codegraph isolation.
 *
 * Each indexed project (Qdrant collection) owns its own
 * `<dataDir>/codegraph/<collectionName>.duckdb` file. The pool lazily
 * opens / initialises a `DuckDbGraphClient` on the first request for a
 * given collection, runs the schema migrations once, and caches the
 * client for subsequent calls.
 *
 * Why per-file:
 * 1. DuckDB is single-writer per file. A shared DB blocks new MCP
 *    processes when an older one holds the lock — silently disabling
 *    codegraph for every project. Per-collection files isolate that
 *    lock to within a single project.
 * 2. The slice 1 schema has no `collection_id` column on the
 *    `cg_symbols_*` tables. Indexing two projects against one DB would
 *    collide on PKs (e.g. both repos with a `README.md` -> duplicate
 *    `cg_symbols_files.rel_path` row). Separate files mean no collision.
 *
 * The pool intentionally has no cap on open instances — tea-rags
 * registers a small number of projects in practice (single digits),
 * and each open DB costs ~one file handle + a small in-memory symbol
 * table. The `release(collectionName)` helper exists for tests that
 * need to reset state.
