 *
 * This is the QUALIFIED-untyped-receiver axis (`agent.update`), distinct from

 * Consumed by `dsl/catalogue.ts:isExternalQualifiedMember` → the dynamic-dispatch
 * guard + the external classifier arm (bd tea-rags-mcp-i9id8).

 * first via the strategy chain and never reaches the guard, so this set never
 * mis-marks a real project method (same invariant as RAILS_RUNTIME_BUILTINS, bd
