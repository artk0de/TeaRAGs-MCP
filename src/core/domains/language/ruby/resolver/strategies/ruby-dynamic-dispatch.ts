 * Dynamic-receiver short-name fan-out (bd tea-rags-mcp-wbj3). A call `recv.m`
 * whose receiver carries NO static type — `arr.map`, `items.each`,
 * `obj[k].call`, a chained/indexed expression — is currently DROPPED by the
 * `receiverSetDrop` guard in the exact chain (the dynamic type is unknown, and
 * guessing a single target fabricates false positives). Rather than drop, this
 * component resolves `m` by global short-name lookup and emits the matches as
 * **discounted** `dynamic` edges: low confidence beats `null`.
 *
 * This is a **fan-out** (N edges with per-edge `confidence`), so it implements
 * `DispatchResolverComponent` — NOT the single-target `SymbolResolutionStrategy`
 * chain, whose `SymbolResolutionTarget` carries no confidence field. It composes
 * behind `RubyCallResolver.resolveDispatch` AFTER the CHA cone: the provider
 * runs `resolveDispatch` first and falls back to the exact chain on `[]`, so a
 * dynamic fan-out slots into the same cone-first path.
 *
 * `resolveDispatch` returns `[]` for every receiver the exact chain OWNS, so
 * exact precedence is preserved and the cone/exact paths stay the default:
 *   - bare call (`receiver === null`)        → bare-call exact path
 *   - super sentinel                          → super exact path
 *   - `self`                                  → self/bare exact path
 *   - constant receiver (`User`, `A::B`)      → constant exact path
 *   - receiver with a local binding           → localType exact path / cone
 *   - AR::Relation chain receiver             → AR-relation guard drop
 *
 * Invariant: an `external` receiver is either a constant (gem class →
 * constant path) or an untyped dynamic receiver whose member has no in-project
 * ruby definition (`[]`) — external receivers never produce a dynamic edge that
 * points outside the project, and `isRubyPath` blocks cross-language pollution
 * (bug pl7k: `arr.map` → vendored `d3.js#map`).
