# TeaRAGs Skills

TeaRAGs ships **agent skills** — ready-made playbooks that tell your agent
_when_ and _how_ to use trajectory signals. Instead of writing long system
prompts or manually composing rerank presets, you install the plugin and your
agent learns the workflow.

There are **6 user-invocable skills** grouped into 3 categories, plus 2 internal
strategies that are called automatically by `explore`.

## Investigation

### `/tea-rags:explore`

Unified code investigation. **Breadth-first discovery → depth-first tracing →
output shaped by intent** (human explanation or pre-generation context).

Use when the developer asks to explore, understand, explain, or investigate
code:

- _"how does X work"_, _"show me the architecture of Y"_, _"what does Z do"_
- _"where is X used"_, _"find all X"_, _"antipatterns in X"_, _"best example of
  X"_
- Pre-generation: _"before I code/change/modify/refactor X"_, _"what should I
  know before touching X"_, _"risks before refactoring X"_

Not for active bugs (use `bug-hunt`), not for standalone health scan without a
specific area (use `risk-assessment`).

### `/tea-rags:bug-hunt [symptom]`

**Signal-driven root cause investigation.** Developer describes the bug symptom
— the skill directs the search toward historically buggy code using chunk-level
`bugFixRate`, `churnVolatility`, and `burstActivity`.

No `git log` / `git blame` needed — the overlay carries git signals.

### `/tea-rags:risk-assessment [scope]`

**Multi-dimensional risk scan.** Uses `rank_chunks` with 4 rerank presets
(`hotspots`, `dangerous`, `techDebt`, `securityAudit`) cross-referenced by
overlap count. Returns the zones that need attention.

Scope can be a path, a domain name, or `"whole project"`. Semantic/hybrid search
resolves intent-based scopes before ranking.

Use when asked to evaluate risks, find problematic areas, or identify zones
needing attention. Not for specific bug symptoms — use `bug-hunt` instead.

## Generation

### `/tea-rags:data-driven-generation`

**Selects a generation strategy based on git signal labels from the target
area.** The skill reads overlay labels (`healthy`, `concerning`, `critical`,
etc.) — not hardcoded thresholds — so strategies adapt to each codebase
automatically.

Prerequisite: area context (files, pathPattern, overlay labels) must already
exist in the conversation. If missing, `explore` is invoked first to gather it.

## Index management

### `/tea-rags:index [path]`

**Smart indexing.** First time on a path → full index. Already indexed →
incremental reindex (only changed files). Called directly via the MCP tool, no
subagent.

### `/tea-rags:force-reindex [path]`

**Zero-downtime full re-index.** Builds a new versioned collection in the
background while search continues on the current one. Alias switches atomically
when done.

Requires **explicit user confirmation** — never invoked automatically, even when
index looks stale.

## Internal strategies

These are invoked automatically by `explore` when it detects a matching intent.
You don't call them directly, but it's useful to know they exist:

- **`pattern-search`** — find all implementations of a pattern across the
  codebase (`seed → expand → deduplicate → group`). Triggered when the intent is
  "find all X" or "where do we do Y".
- **`refactoring-scan`** — multi-preset breadth-first scan for refactoring
  candidates. Triggered when the intent is "what to refactor in X" or "cleanup
  Y" without a specific entity.

## Installation

Skills ship with the TeaRAGs Claude Code plugin. When the plugin is installed,
all skills are registered automatically and your agent can invoke them via
`/tea-rags:<skill-name>`.

See [Quickstart → Connect to an Agent](/quickstart/connect-to-agent) for plugin
installation.
